					<h1>About Shockline Hosting</h1>
					<p>Shockline Hosting was a Minecraft hosting company and joint venture by my buddy Nick Osmonovich and myself.</p>
					<p>The website went through various iterations over the year and a bit the company had been operational for. All versions were handbuilt by myself with HTML, CSS and jQuery. This version linked and shown above is the second version of the site - this was never used as the company was shut down before it was completed.</p>
					<h2>Pre-Release</h2>
					<p>While I dont have the screen shot of the completed product, the pre-release version was a red/beige scheme with a simpler design. I kind of preferred this to the blue/black of the later themes.</p>
					<h2>Version 1</h2>
					<p>The first released version of the site was released with a blue/black theme. This was the first website I ever completed from start to finish. Unfortunately I dont have a screen shot or a copy of this original site.</p>
					<h2>Version 1.1</h2>
					<p>This is when we were implementing StarMade hosting. I built a simple 2 tab display in jQuery for it. Not much else changed in this update.</p>
					<h2>Version 2</h2>
					<p>This is the version linked and shown above. As previously stated it was never released due to the company closing.</p>
