					<h1>About ed3n.me</h1>
					<p>ed3n.me is my personal portfolio and brand.</p>

					<p>I originally started ed3n.me for my personal portfolio back in 2013. I chose "ed3n" as a reference to my online alias "edenwax" which I use for almost everything. I also like short domains and eden.me was taken so I went with ed3n.me</p>

					<p>ed3n.me has gone mostly unused until recently. Even though I've been designing and developing, I havent had a proper portfolio to house my work. It sat for probably 2+ years with "Coming soon" printed on the homepage.</p>

					<p>This current version of my portfolio, which I refer to as blueset, I started just a few weeks ago. I'll admit, its heavily inspired by some portfolios people were critiquing on /r/design_critiques and /r/web_design. The version previous to this site, referred to as Clouds, was my first completed version of a portfolio ever. Unfortunately I really dont like how it turned out and so Blueset came to be.</p>

					<p>I'll have a screen shot for each itteration of my portfolio listed on the right.</p>
