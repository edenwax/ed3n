					<h1>About my work for Dotbu.com</h1>
					<p>Dotbu was a social network project by Luke Mansell</p>
					<p>Luke had recruited me as a designer for Dotbu. The first and only project I got to work on was the splash page while Dotbu was under development. Unfortunately I never heard back from Luke after creating it and as far as I know it was never used. To be honest, I'm not even sure he saw it.</p>

					<p>The Dotbu project doesnt seem to be in development any longer.</p>
