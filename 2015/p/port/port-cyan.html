					<h1>About Cyanima</h1>
					<p>Cyanima is an image-hosting site, much like Imgur, ImageShack and so on.</p>
					<p>I originally created Cyanima to compete with smaller image hosts that were popular on the old Proboards communities. The name came from the original design of the site which was Cyan in color. "Cyan Image" didnt sound very good, but "Cyanima" had a nice feel. After various redesigns it ended up being orange & very basic in functionality. Primitive would be the best way to describe it, really.</p>
					<p>The current version (version 4) was started in August of 2015 during a 2 week staycation. I was able to hand code the entire thing & implemented proper PDO which was a huge learning curve for me. Its functionality is simple, design is a little ugly, but Im fairly proud of it. A few months ago I even gave it its own domain "cyan.im" because I thought it would be cool if the URL's were cyan.im/a/img.png.</p>
