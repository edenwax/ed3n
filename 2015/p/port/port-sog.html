					<h1>About Spiral Out Games</h1>
					<p>Spiral Out Games is currently my failed attempt at a gaming network and social hub.</p>
					<p>Being friends with mostly all gamers, I had wanted to create a gaming network that we could all be a part of and be the hub of our social circle.  The name was inspired by the song "Lateralus" by Tool.</p>

					<!-- SPIRAL OUT. KEEP GOING. -->
					<p>If Im completely honest, the reason why this is in my Portfolio is that its a placeholder. I didnt design the forum, its a custom-made MyBB theme that I tweaked. I did the logo and imagework, though.</p>
