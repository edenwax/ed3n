					<h1>About my RT site</h1>
					<p>Radiant Technology was a web dev group I was briefly a part of.</p>
					<p>I was recruited as web designer to help their developers create elegant and intriguing web apps. However due to my inexperience as a designer, the website didnt turn out the way we hoped. It was outdated, irrelevant to the name "Radiant" Technologies and it was never finished - After a few short weeks I chose to leave Radiant Technologies. Not only due to my lack of skill in web design, but I was working full time and trying to run a Minecraft hosting company at the same time. I simply didnt have enough time to keep working with them.</p>
