                            Hello, my name is Colin. I'm a web designer and aspiring web developer. I currently 
                            reside in Nanaimo, BC - Canada and I'm currently employed 
                            as tech support for a Shaw Communications. I've been designing websites 
                            since I was 13 years old, customizing Proboards forums and creating small websites 
                            with friends. I then branched off into image hosting, Minecraft server hosting, and 
                            now I'm into designing clean, functional and engaging user interfaces. Currently I'm 
                            fairly comfortable with HTML & CSS, but slowly Javascript & PHP are starting to make 
                            more and more sense.

                                <p>I'm currently working on the next version of Cyanima. Im trying to overhaul the uploader to be able to support dragging and dropping of images, uploading via url, and using CTRL-V to paste images into the uploader. It will also include additional user controls and settings.</p>
